# 8	Change Management process (변경관리 프로세스)
Identify the change management process to be used to identify, log, evaluate, and update the SRS to reflect changes in project scope and requirements.
1)	How are you going to control changes to the requirements?
2)	Can the customer just call up and ask for something new?
3)	Does your team have to reach consensus?
4)	How do changes to requirements get submitted to the team?
5)	Formally in writing, email or phone call?

This process can be specified in the one of the ‘Process Diagram’s of the company.
